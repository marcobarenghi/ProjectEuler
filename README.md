Most interesting problems (imo) so far and why:
- ex14: dynamic programming
- ex15: just a math problem
- ex18: bottom-up approach (same for ex67)
- ex24: use of permutations - gigantic performance booster
- ex28: designing algorithm to build the spiral
- ex30: recursion vs dynamic programming
- ex35: several opt steps to reduce computational time
- ex39: taking highschool trigonometry out of the closet ^^
- ex54: building entire logic of poker
- ex61: probably the deepest but well structured nest I have ever written
- ex66: quadratic Diophantine equations required SO MUCH research time. Several trial and error attemps
- ex69-70: brute force attempt provided a suggestion to the asnwers ^^ always invest time on trying stuff out
